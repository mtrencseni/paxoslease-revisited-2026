---- MODULE PaxosLeaseImpl ----
(***************************************************************************)
(* A model of the protocol that Keyspace and ScalienDB actually implement,  *)
(* as opposed to the protocol in spec/PaxosLease.tla.  It differs from the  *)
(* base specification in exactly two rules, both taken from the audited     *)
(* sources (see the paper's audit section):                                 *)
(*                                                                          *)
(*   1. The lease timer starts when the proposer has a prepare quorum in    *)
(*      hand (StartProposing in PLeaseProposer.cpp and                      *)
(*      PaxosLeaseProposer.cpp: expireTime = Now() + duration), which is    *)
(*      the step-3 rule of the 2012 paper, not the figure's prepare-time    *)
(*      rule.  In this module pendingDeadline is therefore set in           *)
(*      SendAccept, not StartAcquire.                                       *)
(*                                                                          *)
(*   2. A separate attempt timeout of RetryTimeout time units               *)
(*      (ACQUIRELEASE_TIMEOUT in the sources) starts when Prepare is sent.  *)
(*      When it fires, the attempt is abandoned: the real code re-prepares  *)
(*      with a fresh proposal identifier, which this module represents as   *)
(*      the phase returning to "idle" (a subsequent StartAcquire is the     *)
(*      re-prepare).  Responses to the abandoned ballot are then unusable,  *)
(*      exactly as the proposalID comparison discards them in the sources.  *)
(*                                                                          *)
(* The constant TimelyDispatch selects between two semantics for that      *)
(* timeout, corresponding to the two sides of the audit's conclusion:      *)
(*                                                                          *)
(*   TimelyDispatch = TRUE: the timeout callback runs as soon as the        *)
(*      deadline passes, before any further message processing by that     *)
(*      proposer.  Tick enforces this by abandoning every overdue attempt   *)
(*      as time advances.  This models an event loop that is never paused   *)
(*      between its timer scan and its socket poll.                         *)
(*                                                                          *)
(*   TimelyDispatch = FALSE: expiry merely enables AbandonAttempt, which    *)
(*      may be delayed arbitrarily (or forever, within the horizon).        *)
(*      Message processing remains enabled while the overdue timeout       *)
(*      waits, which is what a process suspension between the timer scan    *)
(*      and the poll produces in the shipped event loop.                    *)
(*                                                                          *)
(* The implementations do not check an attempt deadline in their Phase 2    *)
(* response handlers (OnProposeResponse checks only the lease expiry), so   *)
(* DeliverAccepted deliberately carries no such guard here: under delayed   *)
(* dispatch a stale attempt can activate.  That is the defect, not a        *)
(* modeling artifact.                                                       *)
